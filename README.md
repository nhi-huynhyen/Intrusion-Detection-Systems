# IntrusionDetection
## Intrusion Detection using Machine Learning & Data Augmentation

This project explores intrusion detection by combining synthetic data generation techniques and machine learning models. The work has been accepted and presented at the 12th International Conference on Future Data and Security Engineering (FDSE 2025), held in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, from November 27–29, 2025. The paper titled “Evaluating Sampling Strategies and Generative Models for Addressing Class Imbalance in Intrusion Detection Systems” appears in the FDSE 2025 proceedings published by Springer. [Paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-95-4721-0_8) 

### Techniques Used:
- **Feature Selection**:
  - Gini Importance
  - Permutation Importance
  - SHAP Values 
- **Data Generation**: 
  - CGAN (Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks)
  - SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique)
  - VAE (Variational Autoencoder)
- **Classification Models**:
  - XGBoost
  - Random Forest

The generated synthetic data helps address class imbalance in intrusion datasets, leading to improved detection accuracy.
